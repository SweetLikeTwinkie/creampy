Agent.update

This script is responsible for checking for updates and performing updates
for the agent. It communicates with a remote update server to determine
if a new version is available and initiates the update process if necessary.

Dependencies:
- requests: Used for making HTTP requests to check for updates.
- logger: Custom logging module for recording update-related events.

Usage:
- Call `check_for_update(current_version, update_endpoint)` to check if an update is available.
- If a new version is found, use `perform_update(new_version, download_url)` to initiate the update process.

def check_for_update(current_version, update_endpoint):
    """
    Checks whether a new version of the agent is available.

    :param current_version: str - The currently installed version of the agent.
    :param update_endpoint: str - The URL of the update server to check for new versions.
    :return: str or None - Returns the new version string if an update is available, otherwise None.

    Process:
    1. Sends a GET request to the update server.
    2. If the response is successful (HTTP 200), it extracts the version information from the JSON response.
    3. Compares the received version with the current version.
    4. If a new version is found, logs the update and returns the new version string.
    5. If any error occurs (network issues, invalid response, etc.), logs the error and returns None.

    Potential Enhancements:
    - Add retry mechanisms in case of transient network failures.
    - Validate the response format before accessing the "version" key.
    - Implement a version comparison strategy for semantic versioning support.

    Process:
    1. Logs the initiation of the update process.
    2. The actual update mechanism should be implemented within this function.

    Steps to Implement:
    - Download the update package from the provided URL.
    - Verify the integrity of the downloaded package (checksum verification).
    - Apply the update (replace necessary files, restart the agent if required).
    - Ensure rollback mechanisms in case of a failed update.

    Security Considerations:
    - Ensure that the update URL is trusted and secure (use HTTPS).
    - Validate the update package before executing it to prevent malicious updates.
    - Implement a digital signature verification mechanism to authenticate the update source.
